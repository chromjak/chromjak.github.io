Positive thinking has been helping us for a long time now. It gives us a more optimistic outlook, lets us look for solutions and drives us to improve our selves and our environment.

Unfortunately, sometimes it is accepted dogmatically as a single solution to our problems. Without consideration, some people are quick to point out that you are been negative when voicing a concern. This can be dangerous; it prevents us from considering all possible outcomes of a situation, even the negative one and plan for it. 

Whenever I feel anxiety or fear over a situation, I ask myself "What is the worst that can happen?" I try to explore all worst possible scenarios and how I could deal with them. Despite what the "positive thinking" movement claims it does not make me miserable, quite the opposite.

Once I explore the possible negative outcomes, I take additional steps to prevent them or minimize their impact. Secondly, I usually realize that that worst case scenario isn't as bad as I thought.  This releases a lot of the anxiety and stress from the situation, making me feel more positive and more likely to handle the situation better.
