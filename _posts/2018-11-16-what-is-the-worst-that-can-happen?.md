Why are we hoarding thousands of photographs? Trying to amass to our life memory bank. Dreaming of one day cozing up on the sofa with our children or friends and flick through ten thousand photos. Feeling proud of our moments and travels. You would get tired after a few hundred photos, and your friends long bored to death, looking for an excuse to leave.

Life happens now, moment by moment. It is better to experience beautiful moments instead of worrying about future memories. Enjoy the moment instead of taking photos of it.
