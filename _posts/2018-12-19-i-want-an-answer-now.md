We want simple solutions and quick answers to our problems, but life is a lot more complicated. 

One reason is we like to tick things off our list and move on; we don't want things lingering on our minds so accept instant resolutions even if wrong.

Another reason is it takes a lot of effort to look at a problem from multiple angles, consider their future impact and devise plans to deal with them. 

Instead of taking the time and making an effort, we reduce problems complexity to get our simple answer. In doing so, the probability of a wrong conclusion is very high.

Not surprisingly answers that begin with "It depends..." tend to be more thought through with higher accuracy.
