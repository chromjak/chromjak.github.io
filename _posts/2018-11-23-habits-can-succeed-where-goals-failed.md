Have you been struggling with following through on longer-term goals? Switch from setting goals to habits. For example, instead of setting a goal to lose 20 lbs, create daily habits to eat healthily and exercise. Habits offer numerous advantages over goals.

We are bad at estimating the time the goal would take to accomplish. When we start falling behind on a goal, we get discouraged causing our efforts to decline. We often give up feeling guilty which makes it even harder to follow through on the next goal.

Goals are like a strict diet, the process feels difficult and requires a lot of mental energy to sustain, having only the prospect of reward at the end to keep us going. Habits unlike goals, produce small satisfaction from daily achievements, and thus we are more likely to persevere in the long term as the process is more positive and rewarding.

Habits feel more like learning or experiment so making changes won't raise as many negative emotions as goals do for not following through. We pent on it, pivot or scrap it and pick up a different habit.  

After the initial period -usually few weeks- habits become a routine that is easy to sustain, it often feels effortless.

Since I swapped my fitness goals with habits I have seen best improvements in the last 15 years, I just set habits to eat and exercise with long-term health in mind.

Not all goals can be easily converted into habits, so start with the obvious easy one and once it doesn't require much effort to sustain pick another one. Get a habit app on your mobile phone and set reminders.  

Put a stop to the guilt trips from failed goals and replace them with habits. You will enjoy the journey and are more likely to reach the destination. Habits can succeed where goals failed.
