Everywhere we look people seem to have it all figured out and giving advice to others. Some figure it out from the comfort of their sofa, others go out and take action that sometimes pays off.

The first group is lazy and more than 99% wrong so stay away from them. The second group of doers picks up useful habits and knowledge on the way, so it is worth listening to but do so very cautiously. 

The doers that fail will try to convince us why something doesn't work and those who succeeded why it worked. The failures are usually due to outside forces, and successes attributed to them. 

The failures are easier to spot as false advice, but the successes are harder as their reasoning makes sense and they have the result to prove it.

Examine the reasoning behind the decisions that led to success and their track record before adopting the advice. Failure doesn't necessarily mean the decisions and action were wrong, and one success doesn't prove our contribution was the deciding factor.
