The self-help genre frequently advocates reading non-fiction as one of the contributing factors to success. Examples of famous entrepreneurs with the number of books they read are given to drive the point in. Motivated readers devour Amazon's top-rated books or audio versions on high speed. After a book is finished, there is a short euphoric moment. But after few books under the belt, we are still the same people, no change has taken place, so the motivation fades, and the reading habit is forgotten.

Simply coping successful people and reading as many books as they do is a waste of time. You are in a reading race so you can brag to friends how many books you have read. You wonâ€™t retain much and implement next to nothing.

Chose quality books and read less. Set a low limit of books per year. Reread the books to retain more and highlight relevant passages. Transfer the highlights into actionable goals and tasks in your to-do system and schedule time to work on them. Modify or discard what isn't working, and implement what is. Some knowledge can be applied as one-off tasks other can be turned into habits.

Reading a hundred books a year won't magically transform you into a billionaire, but the application of knowledge learned may help.
