The information we used to receive was filtered by newspaper, magazine, book and TV publishers and editors. Only the content someone deemed relevant, valuable or fit their agenda reached us. This system kept us sane, but the information was limited.

Now we are living in the age of the Internet where anybody can create content that can reach masses. There is no longer a gatekeeper to decide what gets published. This gave birth to a vast variety of free and instantly accessible content. We can learn new skills, connect with like-minded people and work anywhere.  

But having no information gatekeeper also means there is nobody to filter out the low-quality and sometimes even hateful content. Add to it the fear of missing out, we are maniacally trying to consume all the information we are bombarded by.

The responsibility to set an information filter rests on us now.
Decide what content is helpful and relevant to you, and consume it at the time chosen by you.
