It saddens me to meet people below the poverty level in developed countries like UK or USA. Their self-narrative is often full of excuses, blame, low self-esteem, and feeling powerless.

The internet connected devices give us enormous power, unprecedented in the history of humankind. It doesnâ€™t matter what your situation is now, your current knowledge, finances or skin color. The vast number of high-quality free education for any level and professional tools allow anybody with a device and internet connection to learn and improve their lives.

Do not waste your precious time on this earth believing that you have no choices or that you cannot do it. Stop making excuses and start today. You can start small but keep learning every day.
