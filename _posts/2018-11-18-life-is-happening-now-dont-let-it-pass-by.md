We perceive time in three layers, past, present and future. The present is the only time when life happens, but we spend too much of our lives in the past or future. This is often a form of escapism when we don't want to face the difficulties of the present.

The time spent reminiscing about the good times or tormenting ourselves with past mistakes is a waste of present time and ultimately life. Similarly, spending too much time making elaborate plans for the future and daydreaming about it will not make it happen.

Spend the minimum time in the past or future and use it intentionally. Analyze your past to learn from the good and bad decisions. Make plans and goals for the future, but remember they will only happen in the present.

Learn from the past and plan for your future but live the rest in the present.
