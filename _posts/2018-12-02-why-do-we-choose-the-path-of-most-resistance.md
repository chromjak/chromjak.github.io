We are drawn to goals that haven't been done before. This drive moves the humanity forward. But I am not referring to those big endeavors, I am talking about our personal everyday lives, where we often chose difficult paths to our detriment.

Animals naturally chose a path of least resistance but we humans not as much. What leads us to abandon logic and take what is often clearly a difficult path. One reason is we tend to overthink problems and miss simple solutions. Children can often beat us at problem-solving.

Another reason is our unresolved psychological issues create a tunnel vision thinking. We get fixated on that one idealized goal that we have to reach to be happy. Itâ€™s that or nothing, no other options are viable. We believe only a particular path can take us to our destination.

We justify the disproportionate amount of resources as the price of success. Too of our life is spent on paths that lead nowhere.

If the path gets rough, ask yourself if there are other routes you can take or if the destination is still worth it.
