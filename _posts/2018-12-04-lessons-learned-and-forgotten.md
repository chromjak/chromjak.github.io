We like to bask with pride in the newly learned lesson. It feels like reaching a small milestone in our life. From now, life will be just that little bit better. Fast forward month or years, we make the same mistake again. What happened to our lesson learned? We forgot.

We severely overestimate our mind's abilities. We remember far less than we realize, and what we do remember is often distorted.

Other times, we swear we never make the same mistake again, just to find ourselves in a similar situation again.

We can get overly generous with people and confuse forgiving with forgetting. One of my coaches used to say "I have forgiven, but I have a long memory." This advice served me well in life, as long as didn't allow the society make me feel guilty about remembering.

We cannot depend on our mind alone. We have to pursue clear thinking intentionally and daily.
