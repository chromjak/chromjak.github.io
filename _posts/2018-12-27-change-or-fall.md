I made a grand plan yesterday, all figured out, excited and ready to begin the journey. 

I woke up this morning, and the world has changed without consulting me. My carefully laid out plans are worthless now. 

Do I cry or rage against the unfairness and push through with my plan and a useless map? No, those were the foolish ways of my youth. 

I made the plan yesterday, and that day has gone. Today it's a new world; I shall make a new plan and set off early to make an advance. 

I don't know what change will tomorrow bring, but whatever it is I shall welcome and befriend it quickly before my enemies do.
