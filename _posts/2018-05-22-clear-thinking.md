## Survivorship Bias
Are you overestimating the chances of success by concentrating on small sample of successful results because they are more visible? Have you intentionally searched for unsuccessful results?

## Swimmer's Body Illusion
Professional swimmers donâ€™t have their kind of body because they train hard; rather, they are good swimmers because they have that kind of body and that was a factor for selection to become a swimmer.
Are you confusing selection factors with results? Are you being sold an illusion?

## Clustering Illusion
Tendency to consider random streaks or clusters in small samples to be patterns. Are you imagining patterns where there are none?
