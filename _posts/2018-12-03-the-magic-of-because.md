Watch out whenever you hear the word because after a request. This word has the power to justify an unreasonable request unquestionably.

Pay extra attention to what comes after the word "because." It often lacks any justification or reasoning. Request such as "Can I skip the queue because I need to cash my cheque?" would be granted often. But why, we are all waiting in the queue for something, including cashing cheques.

The word "because" seems to switch off our rational thinking and go to an automatic "yes" mode. We may start regretting the decision, but by then it is too late.

When we justify our behavior or requests, we receive more tolerance and helpfulness from others. We all need it sometimes. But It becomes an issue when it is an excuse for laziness or being used purposefully to gain an advantage.
