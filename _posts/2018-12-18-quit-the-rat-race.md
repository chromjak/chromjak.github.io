The society with its economics of production and consumption of goods and services is set to capture the maximum commercial benefit from us without completely ruining us. Giving us just enough room to get up and keep running. 

We are paying for houses whole our lives, overpaying as much as twice the price of the property. A university student entering the workforce with a massive debt has no advantage over the other candidates. It feels like the Matrix movie, but instead being used to generate electricity we power the economics. 

An individual has little power to change the system but has the power to quit the race of consumption.
