Take it; it's free, I am told. True, sometimes there are no strings attached, but even then, we attach them ourselves.

When someone does something for us, it is more than a free service or product. Emotionally we feel indebted, a feeling we find uncomfortable, so we are susceptible to repay the favor at the slightest suggestion and sometimes disproportionately high. 

This reciprocity tendency has been hardwired in us by evolution and serves its purpose but also makes us susceptible to manipulation.

Personally, my default setting for a free offer is "no thank you." It saved me from getting indebted to the wrong people,  hoarding useless junk, and if it is a genuine and useful offer, I can usually accept it later.
