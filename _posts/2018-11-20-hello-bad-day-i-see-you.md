AGood habits and mindfulness help us with our challenges and insulate us partially from the influences of our monkey brain. Daily practice is like a fuel for a train that generates momentum that can push through obstacles without losing much energy.

But we are not immune to bad days that will come occasionally despite our physical and mental practice. It doesn't take much, a disturbed night with lack of sleep is enough to wreak havoc in our day. Everything seems to irritate us, and our fuse is a lot shorter than usual. A train loaded with negative thoughts can gain momentum very fast if we don't catch ourselves early on. We don't want this train to start rolling and smash everything we built so far.

All we can do is recognize the bad day early, and accept that we will have to slow down, lighten our load and pay more attention to ourselves.
