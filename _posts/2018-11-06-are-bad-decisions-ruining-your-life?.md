Looking back at my life and mistakes I made, I realized they come down to lack of clear thinking at the time.

There were two leading causes of my bad decisions:

1. Unresolved emotional issues led me to make decisions allowing me to escape from the problems into what I believed would be a much better situation.
2. Not putting enough effort into researching different options and considering their potential benefits and risks.

Realizing this and putting in place daily habits to address these causes made one of the most significant improvements in my life. Practicing Stoicism, meditation, and exercise daily help me with my emotions.  Study of cognitive biases improves my ability to think more clearly.
