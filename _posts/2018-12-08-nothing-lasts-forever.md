Everything we love and own, everything we built our whole lives can be taken away instantly. As sad as the impermanence of life can make us feel, dwelling on it won't help. We can only accept it and prepare for it. But most importantly don't live in the illusion of permanence.

Accept that our life and everything in it is subject to a chance. Think of everything you value as a loan that can be withdrawn at any time. Even if you have the best possible life, death will eventually take it all.

Treat life is like a stock market. It moves in cycles, ride and enjoy the uptrend but be ready for the reversal to downtrend at any time.
