title: Our purchasing power can make a real difference

We consumers like to think that brand advertising does not influence us and that our purchase decisions are logical, but that is often not true.

Subconsciously we chose brands that sell us some version of "feeling special". We rationalize our purchase afterward to avoid feeling guilty about it.

We happily become a walking billboard. If a company wanted to place an advertisement on our car, we would expect to get paid for it, but we are happy to advertise on our bodies and pay a premium for the privilege.

But what do we advertise? The truth is most brands donâ€™t stand for anything and without a deeper meaning their promise of "feeling special" won't last so we have to keep coming back for more.

Ask your self these questions before purchase:
- What is the drive behind this purchase, do I need this item, does it add value? This requires real honesty.
- Am I buying a high-quality premium item that is well designed and will last longer, or am I paying mostly for the brand name?

Making conscious purchasing decisions also allows us to support brands that stand for something more than themselves, whether it is the environment, charity or oppose unfair industry practices. Brands facing losing sales would be forced to find worthy causes to the pursuit.

Our purchasing choices -however small they may seem- collectively make a difference and can have a positive impact in the world.
