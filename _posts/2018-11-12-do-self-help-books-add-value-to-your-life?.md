We are being advised by successful people and bloggers to read non-fiction, as many successful people swear by it. You don't want to feel missing out, so you jump right in, digesting all Amazon top sellers. As with many things in life "Quality over quantity" holds true here too.

High ratings or sales doesn't always mean quality, the more you read, the better you get at weeding out the garbage. Find out who is the author and what makes him an expert in the field. Go beyond the shiny site and twitter followers, look for a track record of delivering value.

Don't feel you need to finish the book just because "everyone" seems to love it or you paid for it. If it doesn't feel right or provide value move on to the next one, no regrets.

You read the book, and you are feeling pumped from all the information and advise you going to implement next week. A few months later you come across the book realizing you haven't done anything, even worse you don't even remember much of what you read.

To retain more information reread the book or at least the highlights. Take notes as you read and schedule time for implementation with notifications.

Make it a challenge to follow the advice for a set period -for example, 30 days- and make a real effort at it, modify it if you need but keep at it. If you don't feel it added any value at the end of the challenge, drop it and move on to the next one.

Reading self-help books adds value only if is implemented.
