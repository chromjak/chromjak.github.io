Was your success due to skill or just luck? Consider it carefully before arguing. We don't want to hear that our success was due to being in the right time at the right place or meeting the right people. Yes, it does take hard work and perseverance to make it happen, but without that chance in life, the hard work and skill won't make much difference.

I have noticed interesting occurrences in my life. I have been in thousands of situations and met countless people in my life. Almost none of them have had any long-term impact on my life. But once in a while -sometimes years apart- I am in the right place or meet that certain someone. That triggers serious of events that move me in a short period of time to an entirely new level, far exceeding years of previous effort.

I have watched a reality show that followed successful ex-entrepreneurs who exited their old businesses and decided to start a new one. Almost none them could replicate their previous success.

It is hard to accept that we have far less control of our lives than we think, but in doing so, we can free ourselves from an illusion of our contribution.
