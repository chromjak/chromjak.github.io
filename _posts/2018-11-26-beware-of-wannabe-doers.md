You meet someone, and the conversation eventually leads to a project or business idea. The person loves the idea with passion, and you dive deep into the subject. You feel a shared connection with the person about the project, and you both express commitment. Often you never hear from the person again, and if you do meet again, it is like the conversation never happened. Other times, the project takes off, and you become the driving force behind the project fueled by your passion. Then one day you wake up exhausted and realizing your partner is just coming along for the ride.

You allowed the early excitement to cloud your judgment and missed the early signs a wannabe doer. Question the reasons and sources behind their opinions. Their claim may often be ungrounded. Some individuals would go to an extreme, substantiating their claims with made up stories and evidence. Do your homework about your future partner.

Donâ€™t be always the driving force, give them a chance to be proactive and show initiative. See if they come back with an intent to proceed, manage and complete aspect of the project. If not, walk away.

Keep emotions in check when entering into partnerships and look for action and results.  Entering into a partnership with a wrong partner can prove costly, mentally and financially.
