Hearing a parent proudly pronounce "I live for my kids" leaves me feeling sorry for the person. 

Having kids is an amazing experience, they are a source of immense joy, make us feel proud and push us to become better people. However noble it may feel, having a life purpose reduced to maintaining a lineage is a waste of one's life. Perhaps it is a form of escape from the challenges of life, but one day the kids will leave the house, and the unfaced issues will resurface.

Even worse, the parent models a behavior the kids are likely to adopt later as parents. If everyone lived for their kids, who would actually live and enjoy life?
