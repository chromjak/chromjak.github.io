If you are like most people, you want both. They are not mutually exclusive with many examples to prove that. But your odds of living a fulfilling life decrease when fitting in is a priority. 

It forces us to align our thinking and actions with our current peer group, which rarely encourages individual growth. If you suppress your ambitions and accept peer thinking, you will fit in, but if you stick your head out it is often met with disapproval. Our fear of being expelled from the group keeps us from growing.

Doing something meaningful and worthwhile always comes with resistance so expect it, if it doesn't, you are probably aiming too low. The question is how much do you want it?

If you feel your group is limiting you, it is time to find a new one that matches your ambitions. If you can't find the right group now go solo until you do.
