title: Keep self-help books helpful

When I buy a book from the self-help category, I expect it to provide actionable knowledge, but that is often not the case. 

With the rise of ebooks and self-publishing, this medium is sometimes used for marketing. Upselling is fine by me as long as enough actionable information is provided in the book. Some books, however, will Introduce ideas and then spend the rest of the book selling them to me, claiming the application is too complicated to explain and requires premium services. 

When I am subjected to advertising in other media, I pay with my attention and time, but when I pay for a book which is an advertisement, I waste my money and a lot more time. For frequent readers like me, the cost of wasted time adds up fast.

To avoid this, when I pick up a new book to read I set a timer for ten minutes and start scanning through the book reading through the beginnings and ends of chapters and any headlines. When the timer goes off, either I feel intrigued and decide to read it or put the book away and move on. 

Sometimes I may find useful ideas during the ten minutes that are simple to grasp and don't justify reading the whole chapters, so I highlight them. If needed I set further ten-minute timers to scan the rest of the book. I have extracted useful information from many books in 30 minutes. These are books that should have been a long blog post.
