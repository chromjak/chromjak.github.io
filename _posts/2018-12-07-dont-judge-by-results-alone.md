We see this mistake repeatedly in financial markets. A portfolio manager gets few lucky strikes riding a trend. He is praised and given more money to manage. Then trends reverse and luck run out. Massive losses follow leaving everyone in shock. How could this happen?

This tendency is not limited to the financial markets but affects all areas of our lives. We see it daily in businesses and politics. If a decision outcome is positive people get praised, if not we have someone to blame.

Good decisions breed long-term success but don't guarantee positive outcomes every time. Results can be influenced by factors outside of our control to a large extent, sometimes making the decision irrelevant. Chance plays more significant role than we realize.

I can't help but feel sorry for people getting blamed for things that were largely out of their control.

We can evaluate a person by his decisions far more precisely than by the outcomes alone. Don't get overly focused on results but study the decisions. Decisions are in our control outcomes are not.
