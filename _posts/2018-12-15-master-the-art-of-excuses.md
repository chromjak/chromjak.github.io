When we keep avoiding doing -or not doing- something we know we should, we feel uncomfortable guilt. There are two solutions to end it. Get up and take action or use logical reasoning to silence the mind. 

Doing something worthwhile takes an effort and requires facing our fears, while reasoning from a sofa is a lot more comfortable, so we go with excuses.

The key is to find valid excuses like lack of finances, belonging to the wrong social class, skin color, health problem, family responsibilities and so on. Then rehearse them to perfection and use them whenever you feel confronted on an issue. When in public, do it in over the top fashion in proud, resolute and load voice. 

With time and practice, you will master this skill and feel (almost) good about yourself.
