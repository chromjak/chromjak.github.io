Whether your life is currently going great or you are struggling through a crisis, remember that nothing lasts forever.  Just as nature or markets move in cycles so do we throughout our lives. Nobody can predict when these cycles begin and end.

During up cycles when all seem to go well for us, we get comfortable and less hungry but do not think it will last forever. Instead, use this time to prepare yourself for the down cycle. Enjoy life but don't waste resources, this is the time to save up, hone your skills, and build up mental and physical toughness.

The down cycle can be anything from an economic downturn to health or family issues. During this time we often lose perspective and hope as we can't see how the situation can improve. Remember that "This too shall pass." The preparation in the up cycle can ease the struggle. As hard as it may seem in the situation, the down periods present an opportunity for growth.

Most of my growth happened during the down cycles when I had no other choice but to find solutions and persevere to achieve them. We are often defined during our darkest times.

Do not just accept the seasons in life but embrace them.
