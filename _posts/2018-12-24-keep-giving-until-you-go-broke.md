The spirit of Christmas giving is here again. The idea sounds great, but stepping back a little and observing the number of gifts being exchanged and the mindless spending by people who cannot afford it is shocking. 

How many gifts are opened but are never used, cluttering the house only to be thrown out later.

The attitude is "It is normal, everybody...", not it is not, it is what we chose to do, mindlessly following others afraid to question it.
