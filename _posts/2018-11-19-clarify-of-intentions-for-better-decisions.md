A lot of bad decisions can be traced to one cause. Coming into a situation without a clear sense of what we want out of it. This makes us more receptive to suggestions and defaults presented to us by others that are often not in our best interest.

Marketers and salespeople have known this for a long time and are great are great at exploiting this state. When you don't need an item going to the mall, the fact that it is supposedly half price doesn't make it a good purchase since you didn't need it in the first place.

You need a clear understanding of what your needs and options are before you enter the situation. Have a point of reference and know what your limit is. For more significant decisions and purchases take along someone who can is emotionally uninvolved and can be clear-headed about the situation.

You should hear alarm bells ringing when you being pressured into making a quick uninformed decision. It is better to pass the offering even if it means missing an opportunity. In the long run, this will save you a lot of headaches and money.

Before entering into a situation that requires decisions, first, clear your head from the previous activity, then clarify what you want out of the next one.
