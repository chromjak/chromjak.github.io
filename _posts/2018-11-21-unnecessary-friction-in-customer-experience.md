title: Unnecessary friction in customer experience

I recently enjoyed reading a few online articles published by the country's major newspaper. As a free user, you are only allowed to read three articles a month. Since I found the content of good quality, I decided to check out the subscription.  I found the pricing very cheap, for the price of two coffees, you can get twelve weeks digital and print subscriptions. The purchase was a straightforward one-page process which I like so I decided to purchase within seconds. 

As a rule, before I make any subscription purchase, I look up the cancelation process. The cancelation was not as simple. You have to sign up for customers support account, and them contact them requesting cancelation or call them. I have gone through these types of cancelations before. Filling a form or writing an email requesting the cancelation, then waiting a day to get a reply that is asking for a reason why you are canceling, sometimes being offered a discount if you sign up for a prolonged period. Calling follows a similar process, waiting in a queue, justifying my action and repeatedly saying no to counter offers. I find this friction a time waste and drain of mental energy.

I understand the company's thinking behind this process. The friction causes some customers repeatedly postponing the cancelation and some accepting a discount. But if the price wasn't an issue in the first place you just did the opposite of removing unnecessary cost, you prolonged it. As a customer I find two problems with this experience:

- Cancelation could be done quickly in two clicks, but you waste my time and energy
- I don't feel I have to justify my actions. You can ask for optional feedback, and I may give it but don't force me to give it to cancel

I had personally resubscribed to numerous services when I needed them again, but I if you make me jump through hoops to cancel I am not coming back.
