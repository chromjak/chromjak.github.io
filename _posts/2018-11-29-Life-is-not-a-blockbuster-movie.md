We love stories and wish our lives to be a happy end blockbuster full of meaning.  When our story doesn't follow the well-rehearsed script, we are disappointed and hopeless.

What if there is no grand meaning, only a series of chances and encounters.

What if life is not just nor unjust. It is merely happening, and we can observe and participate for a moment. That's all our life is a moment in the scheme of things.

We have choices thou. Choices to open those doors before us and explore, or leave them closed and spend our short moment dwelling on them.  

Letâ€™s live life today. Enjoy what it offers us and take those chances with gratitude.
