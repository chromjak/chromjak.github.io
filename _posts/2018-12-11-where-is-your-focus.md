Along with time, focus is the most valuable resource we have in our life, yet we are squandering it without a second thought. It is a finite resource, by giving it to one thing we are saying no to other things.

We happily give it away for free to anybody who shouts the loudest, and while they profit from our attention, we are wasting our time, money and opportunities.

Every time we turn on a device, the entire internet with millions of sites is fighting for our attention, exploiting our curiosity, vulnerabilities, and fears. Most news and revolutionary products -the popular term is "disruptive" these days-  are just not relevant and don't add any value to our lives. 

Be intentional about what you give your focus to and guard it against distractions.
