Many of us spend their lives searching for meaning in our lives. We believe that one day something will happen, a moment of realization that reveals our purpose in life which will lead on a path to fulfillment.

We love the stories of people who had that moment when they realized their calling that put them on the path to success and meaningful life. For the majority, this moment of clarity never seems to happen. It is not that we donâ€™t get moments of inspiration and clarity it is just that they don't look grand, world-changing ideas, so we let them pass by and wait for that big one. Then we get old and wonder why has life failed us.

Perhaps despite the what media makes us believe, the earth-shattering moments of life purpose are scarce. I doubt many of the people who achieved great success were aware of that when they had an idea and acted on it. What they did, however, they acted on the idea and didn't wait on the sideline for the grand one.
