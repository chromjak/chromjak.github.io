We get encouraged by celebrities, bloggers, TV, social media and even phone apps to start a regular physical exercise. The benefits of physical activity are far reaching across all areas of our lives. But alone it is not enough. Our mind has an equally significant impact on the quality of our life.

Exercising mind is not very sexy, so it gets a fraction of the media attention physical exercise does. Don't let that decrease its importance on your life.

Mind and body are designed to work together. Working out only one of them is like driving a can on half the cylinders.  The whole system is operating at low efficiency.

Where to begin:
- Meditate daily.
- Study cognitive biases and clear thinking.
- Study thinking from first principles.
- Start a diary writing down decisions and the reasoning behind them. You can later analyze bad decisions along with the thought processes that let to them.

The benefits:
- The primal monkey brain doesn't get as much saying in decisions
- Discipline seam easier and natural
- Less mental drain to pursue goals
- Clearer mind when making decisions
- Seeing new perspectives to problems that you haven't noticed before
- Having more patience with yourself and others
- Being more positive and driven

You need your mind to be as sharp as your body. Don't leave the monkey in charge.
