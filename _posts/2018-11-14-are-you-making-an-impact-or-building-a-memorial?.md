Making an impact is currently popular and overused phrase. Doing something good for the world and humanity is a noble cause but let's inspect our motivation behind it.

Is it driven by a sincere desire to help others or a subconscious hope of immortality by making our mark in the world? To be remembered and not forgotten by the world because that would mean our lives didn't matter. The vast majority of the people who walked the earth were remembered only by close family or friends for maybe one or two generations. It is highly unlikely you or I will be either.

What matters is our own experience of now and how we affect others' experience.
