We gain satisfaction and joy in life through two elements. The pleasure element, also known as instant gratification and a meaningful element. Both play an essential part in our lives, but the problem arises from the lack balance between them.

Good food, drink, TV, gadgets or sex are great pleasures of our lives. But too much of them can become a drug of choice as we try to numb the emptiness from lack of meaning in life. The enjoyment ends soon after the moment does, so we seek even more short-term distractions.

Laboring for delayed rewards -be it helping the homeless,  environment or building a business- can also lead to unhappiness. We often push ourselves through months, even years of grueling work, hoping the achievement will make us happy. The journey is often long and more tiring than we thought, and many times we don't reach our goal at all. The disappointment from the exhausting journey and failure can break the spirit of the strongest.

Instead, strive to strike a balance between enjoyment and meaning. Reaching meaningful goals is essential to fulfilling life, but we need to refeed on quick pleasures. Switch between meaningful and enjoyable activities daily to avoid extremes.

So if youâ€™ve been trying to make the world a better place today, don't forget to reward yourself with some pleasure.
