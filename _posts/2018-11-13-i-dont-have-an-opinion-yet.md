Opinions are cheap every one seem to have them across many subjects. Often they get picked emotionally, or peer choice is adopted. Once a selection is made people seldom change their minds, and they are willing to defend them vehemently.

The debate then becomes the battle of who wins the argument. This a significant loss to us people and genuine resolution of the issue.

Many subjects are too complex to draw a conclusion without throughout study, considering multiple angles and allowing the findings to be challenged. Most people don’t have the time to invest in such a pursuit, and that is understandable, but the problem is that people feel social pressure and shame to admit that they don’t know and so I don’t have an opinion on the subject.

We should follow scientists, they are one group that by the nature of their field are comfortable saying “We don’t know yet?” Try it it is liberating and contributes to clearer thinking.
