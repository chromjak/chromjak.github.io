We tend to think that our personality doesn't change much during life but that is an illusion. Consider how much you have changed in the last twenty years. You will change as much in the next twenty years. The question is who is at the steering wheel?

Because the changes are very subtle over a long period of time, we don't realize the impact they have. The compound effect is at work here, changing us exponentially.

Past life events triggered changes that shaped us into what we are today. It is a natural process designed to help us evolve.

We emerge from a life crisis as a different person in some respect, but in which direction. Did we let the suffering turn us bitter and resentful, or did we use the suffering as fuel to turn it into something positive?

We have to be mindful of the different ways an event could affect us and make a conscious choice that will benefit our future self.

Changes to our personality happen with or without our awareness, either you make them or the life will.
