Performing a dairy headstand has numerous health benefits, but one that I found most beneficial is what I call a head reset.

The headstand clears my head, calms and grounds me; setting a mindful pace for the day. I find it especially helpful in the mornings when I wake up feeling physically or mentally shuttered, either due to lack of sleep or stress buildup. Waking up with pressure like feeling in the head signals a lousy day ahead, full of negative thinking, short-tempered reactions, and bad decisions.

A two-minute headstand releases the pressure immediately and resets me to my natural self. I may still feel less physical energy throughout the day, but my mind feels clear and less prone to take the negative path. 

Start slowly with a short thirty-second headstand in the morning and increase the time gradually. Make an effort but don't push too far, keep it an enjoyable daily habit that you can maintain effortlessly.
