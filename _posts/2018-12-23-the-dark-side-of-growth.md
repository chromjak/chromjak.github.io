 When we decide to improve our lives, we begin making changes in our thinking and habits. These changes are not always welcomed by our peers. They may react to our changes in with anger or try to make us feel guilty.

It can be especially discouraging when it comes from our closest friends or family. We are torn between trying to maintain the relationships and pursuing our goals. Some people may take a while to accept the new you, others will see it as a betrayal. 

When we are being criticized, it is important to remember that it is about that person not us. Our changes are bringing out their own insecurities and fears. It can be helpful to explain why we are making the changes, but ultimately we have to accept that some relationships may not be a part of our journey.
