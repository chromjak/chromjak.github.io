We felt life was a big deal in high school, but ten years later we laugh about how ridiculous that was. We make the same mistake about the present. We assign high importance to events happening in our lives now. But we won't feel about them that way in ten years; we will be lucky to remember them at all.

The majority of what is happening with and around us now doesn't matter. Few things truly matter in the long term. Remembering that, saves us the emotional rollercoaster we experience about trivial things in our daily lives.

It doesn't matter that the shoes you wanted so much just sold out, buy a different pair.
