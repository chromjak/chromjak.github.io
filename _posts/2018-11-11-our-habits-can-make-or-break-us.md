We are creatures of habits; the good habits are beneficial to our lives while the bad once are a lot more detrimental than we realize.

Daily exercise, for example, improves our health, physical and mental energy. Spending too much time on the sofa, on the other hand, produces the opposite negative results that grow exponentially. Some habits seem too small to make any difference, but over time the compounded growth makes a remarkable impact on our lives.

Start with a habit small enough, so it is easy to implement, and maintain regularly. Setup notifications and depending on the habit, schedule it as early as possible in the day to avoid unexpected events getting in the way. Over time as one habit becomes a natural part of the day and doesn't require any mental energy, start another habit and so on.

Habits have a significant impact on our lives, let's be intentional about them and chose the once that benefit our lives.
