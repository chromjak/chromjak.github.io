During our life trials when feeling low, we may start to feel as if people or the whole world conspired against us. Self-pity is an understandable but pointless response to our problems. We can spiral out of control fast, with destructive consequences.

Self-pity is a waste of time, and it doesn’t change anything. Quite the opposite, it pulls us emotionally further down. Feeling like a victim and complaining adds even more to the unhappiness and people around leave.

Remember you are not the only one feeling like this. Don’t be fooled by people on social media projecting the perfect lives.
Life feels unfair to them too, maybe not today and perhaps not the same problem you are experiencing. But if you knew the whole story, you often wouldn't want to be in their place.

We may have been wronged, but we have a choice to change things or accept them. Resistance to move forward is our choice, and at some point, we are to blame for our situation. Accept the wrongs of the past, manage your emotions and move on.
