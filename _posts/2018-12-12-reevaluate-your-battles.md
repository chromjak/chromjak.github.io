"Choose your battles wisely" is a good advise to follow. The problem is that not all battles are apparent from the beginning.

Some battles develop slowly over time. At some point, we realize had we known the severity of the struggle we would have avoided it. But because we invested so much in it already, we feel it would be all for nothing, so we continue the struggle.

And so the battle continues draining even more energy and resources. Until eventually we are exhausted and have to give in, or we succeed, but the victory feels bitter. We know it was not worth the price we paid. With time we may even give up the prize as it no longer holds any value to us.

All battles come with casualties. If you feel you are in the wrong fight forget your ego and cut your losses short.
