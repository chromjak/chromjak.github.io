Many of us live their lives as if they were going to live forever. Hiding the thought of death in the furthermost corner of their minds as denial will make any difference to our inevitable end.

We are amassing memories and building memorials in the hope of good death, full of happy reflections of the good times we had while surrounded by our loved once. The likelihood of that happening is extremely low. Most of us will meet the end either too quickly, or pumped up full of drugs.

Instead, the thought of death should be on our minds often. It creates a sense of urgency about the precious time we have left, not to waste it but fulfill our goals and dreams.

Being aware of the inevitability of death puts things and events in our life into a clearer perspective and intensifies the experience of life.
