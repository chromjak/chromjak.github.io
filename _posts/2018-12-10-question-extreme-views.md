I have just come across an article claiming how business ideas are worthless and execution is 99% of success. A few years back you would have read articles claiming the opposite, that ideas are everything.

How about the trend of switching from segregated offices to open offices. Could none of the cool kid consider benefits and negatives of both? Some collaborative tasks benefit from team presence while other require uninterrupted concentration.

Fist we go to one extreme, and if that doesn't work, we turn around and go to the other extreme. This tendency is noticeable everywhere from education, business to our personal lives.

Extreme views are popular with media and bloggers as they create sensations. Writers offer valid evidence to support their opinions but conveniently avoid disconfirming evidence.

Resist accepting extreme views at face value, even when multiple famous "experts" advocate it. They are often victims of the herd mentality. One makes a claim and others blindly jump on the bandwagon.
