Henry Ford famously said, "Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it." I have to, unfortunately, agree. Few of us intentionally use the enormous power of our brains productively, and fear is often the reason why.

We care deeply about how others perceive us. Most of us need their own space and time alone to think, but in today's "always on" world, this could be seen as being a loner. Thinking also requires considering the negative possibilities, but we are afraid to be labeled as negative.

Often, when we take time and turn inward, the first thoughts that crop up tend to bring up negative emotions. Those are the things we should have done, but we kept avoiding them. They keep coming up because we haven't dealt with them. Instead, we deliberately keep ourselves distracted and busy to avoid feeling bad. The only way is through them, by accepting the thoughts and letting them in however uncomfortable. We pass through this valley of fear by getting comfortable in this uncomfortable place until. Then it loses its power, and we come out on the other side. We will have to do it repeatedly but, it gets easier.

Don't confuse thinking with a guilt trip. Going over and over something you have done or shouldn't have done repeatedly is not thinking, it is just giving negativity and blame free rains. It is destructive.

We need regularly take time to reflect and think. Schedule it if necessary. Especially the introverts get irritated when they don't get their dose of time alone to recharge.

Thinking improves our odds of success and helps us to deal with our past. Don't let this amazing brain of yours go to waste.
