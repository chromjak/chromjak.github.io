I had always lacked patience; I would get an idea and immediately jump fully into it, invest all hours and spare no expense. Nothing else mattered. I would persist, putting massive effort into the project, and over time often reaching great results.

The cost, however, was too high. All other areas of my life would suffer and after a prolonged time -sometimes even years- of high-intensity pursuit I would get burnt out completely. I couldn't get myself to go any further, and the project would suffer or completely end. Trying to find any middle way always seemed impossible. It was always such a great idea, and I could accept only the highest quality results that demanded a lot of attention.

Eventually, I accepted that I had a lot less control over life and its outcomes than I thought. Reminding myself that this new shiny project may not turn out to be a such a great idea after all. By not being single-mindedly immersed in a single project allows me to keep myself more level-headed and realize much sooner if it is not working out.
