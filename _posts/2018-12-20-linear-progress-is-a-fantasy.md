When we set off to achieve a new goal, our eyes are fixed on the target, and we measure success on the progress made. Some days we make a few steps forward, others a few steps back, but it is never linear. 

If our motivation is progress dependent, we are likely to get demoralized on bad days and quit. Instead, expect those bad days when setting a goal and instead tasks set processes. Processes are not dependant on success but on input.
