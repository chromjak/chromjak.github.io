I love technology, new gadgets, and apps. I used to believe the technology increases our life satisfaction and overall happiness. I was wrong. Technology by itself doesnâ€™t improve our level of happiness. Despite all the technological advances, peoples' overall happiness is not any higher now than it was hundred years ago.

The invention of computers and the Internet brought tools and opportunities on a scale never seen before. Tools to communicate, learn and work virtually on the other side of the planet. 

How does an average person in a developed country use these tools? The majority spend their time on social media sites or playing games. While they both have their place in life, their overuse is creating addictions and sometimes making our lives worse.

Tools, be it digital or physical improve our lifestyle and comfort but can't give us long-term happiness.
