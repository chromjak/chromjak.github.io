Hi, I'm Ivan Chromjak, a full stack web developer, passionate about making beautiful and useful things on the web since 2002 and the author of this blog.

My focus is on delivering solutions over technology. Working with design, front and back end in teams like [PressApps](https://codecanyon.net/user/pressapps){:target="_blank"} Envato Elite or independently on WordPress [plugins](https://codecanyon.net/user/pressapps/portfolio){:target="_blank"} and [themes](https://themeforest.net/user/pressapps/portfolio){:target="_blank"}, Jekyll and HTML templates.
Main technologies I use: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, Sass, Less, Gulp, Grunt, Bower, Git.
Bellow is some of my design work, front and back end work is available on [Envato](https://themeforest.net/user/pressapps/portfolio){:target="_blank"} and [Github](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}){:target="_blank"}.
